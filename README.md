# <p align="center">Simple Social Media Restful API</p>

## Background

There will be a hackathon happening soon at my university. This small project is to revise my backend skills and get ready to develop a full stack application as a prototype for my upcoming project at the event. I've only worked with a JSON database for my coursework, so this is my first time working with MongoDB using Mongoose as an ODM.

## Built with

- Express
- Mongoose
- jsonwebtoken
- bcrypt

## Credits

I followed [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-a-social-media-rest-api-using-node-js-a-complete-guide/) from GeeksforGeeks for most of the things in this project.
